Please see the arpeggio [README](https://github.com/willbinzi/arpeggio/blob/main/README.md) for further details.


The talk borrows heavily from [Schroeder, M. R. (1962). Natural sounding artificial reverberation. Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, 10(3), 219â€“223.](http://www.ece.rochester.edu/~zduan/teaching/ece472/reading/Schroeder_1962.pdf), which I was introduced to via [this](https://medium.com/the-seekers-project/coding-a-basic-reverb-algorithm-part-2-an-introduction-to-audio-programming-4db79dd4e325) blog post.
